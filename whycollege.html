        it can change you and shape you in ways that you might not imagine. College work will challenge and inspire you. In college, you will get to explore subjects 
        in greater depth than you did in high school, choose your own courses and class schedule, and decide which extracurricular activities you’ll focus on and how 
        much time you will give them.</p>

        <p>-Education narrows pay gaps between men and women.<br>

    <p>Student loans are a way to help pay for college which includes things like tuition, books and other supplies and living expenses. 
    </p>
    <p>To apply for a federal student loan, you must first complete and submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Based on the results of your FAFSA, your college or career school will send you a financial aid award letter, which may include the federal student loan options available to you.

    <div class="box">
    <br>
<!--    <h2>WHAT ARE SCHOLARSHIPS?</h2>-->
    <p>College scholarships for women enhance the lives of females through educational opportunities.Scholarship assistance can support students who fall in the gap between high and low income levels — students who may not qualify for a need based scholarship and who do not meet the criteria for a merit based scholarship.By being the student recipient of a scholarship, it is hoped that the students will become philanthropic themselves and "give back" when they are financially able.

    <h1> GRANTS</h1>
    <br>
    <div class="box">
    <br>
<!--    <h2>WHAT ARE GRANTS?</h2>-->
    <p>Grants are non-repayable funds or products disbursed by one party (grant makers), often a government department, corporation, foundation or trust, to a recipient, often (but not always) a nonprofit entity, educational institution, business or an individual. In order to receive a grant, some form of "Grant Writing" often referred to as either a proposal or an application is required.
        
Most grants are made to fund a specific project and require some level of compliance and reporting. The grant writing process involves an applicant submitting a proposal (or submission) to a potential funder, either on the applicant's own initiative or in response to a Request for Proposal from the funder. Other grants can be given to individuals, such as victims of natural disasters or individuals who seek to open a small business. Sometimes grant makers require grant seekers to have some form of tax-exempt status, be a registered nonprofit organization or a local government.
