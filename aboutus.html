	<h2> <br> OUR MISSION: <br> </h2>
<h3>With our website, we hope to empower women to believe that no matter their family income level, location, race, sexuality; <br>that they can succeed in school and in the workplace. We strive to send the message to all women hat they can accomplish<br> anything they set their minds to.</h3>
	   
<h2> WHY WE MADE THIS WEBSITE: <br></h2>
<h3> As a group of girls who met at an organization called "Girls Who Code," we were shocked by the lack of women in high level<br> positions, women pursuing a higher education, and women not feeling that they could even enter the workplace. <br>We know that women can make a difference, just like anyone. <br><br><br><br> </h3>
